# bellsplora - esplora for bellschain!

Fork of [https://github.com/Blockstream/electrs](https://github.com/Blockstream/electrs) but built for Bellscoin.

Changes include the addition of an `--auth` flag which takes `bellscoinrpc:bellscoinrpc` or the like, to supply as RPC credentials.

Also includes addition of the Bellscoin mainnet RPC port and genesis hash, for the sync process to work.
