# bellsplora - esplora for bellschain!

Fork of [https://github.com/Blockstream/electrs](https://github.com/Blockstream/electrs) but built for Bellscoin.

Changes include the addition of an `--auth` flag which takes `bellscoinrpc:bellscoinrpc` or the like, to supply as RPC credentials.

Includes addition of the Bellscoin mainnet RPC port and genesis hash, for the sync process to work. Additionally, the magic number for Bellscoin 0xc0c0c0c0 is included.
